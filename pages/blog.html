                  <p class="blog-post-meta" style="text-align:center">Posted on July 17, 2019 by <a href="../index.html">Kyle Padernilla</a></p>
                   <p>It was roughly around finishing my first semester on my third year as a Computer Science major when I started to look for a minor to take. I had a keen eye for finance and business but struggled to convince myself to take those because the course requirements seemed very daunting to me. That’s when I stumbled upon John Green’s channels video of Economics.</p>

                   <h2>The Concepts and Practical Aspects were Appealing to Me.</h2>

                   <p>I really loved how the two economists who were hosting that section of John Green’s Channel explained it so that It could relate to daily life. I really love how decisions we make crazily relate to economics and how most of the time, an economist decision is a good decision. I looked and did more research about it and eventually found both hosts’ own channels.</p>

                   <p>I remember watching a video about it and this guy(shoutout to him for making economics sounds so fun) explained what opportunity cost with a real life example of his wife buying tickets.</p>

                   <p>So it goes something like this, his wife who was a full time waitress during that time is buying travel tickets to visit family for vacation and her flight choices were Thursday $100, Friday $150 and Saturday $175. From a quick look it looks like the most logical choice would be to buy the thursday tickets right? Well he basically explained this to her when she asked him for his opinion:</p>

                   <p><strong>“Since you work full-time, for those weekdays you roughly earn around $200 a day right? Well, if you worked on Thursday and Friday and bought the Saturday tickets, you would have gotten $400. subtract that by $175(Saturday Tickets) and you would made $225. with a $125 as the opportunity cost/profit” </strong></p>

                 <h2>I’ve Wasted Money ever Since I was a Kid.</h2>

                 <p>I thought long and hard about that as ever since I was young I always wasted money and complained why I wouldn’t have money anymore but i feel like economic concepts are so practical I can apply them to my daily life. Whether it be expenses, or financial decisions of the future.</p>

                 <h2>My Current and Next Steps.</h2>

                 <p>I’ve taken three economic courses so far(Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Environmental Economics) , and I’m only left with two more to finish the requirements for the minor for my last year.</p>

                 <p>I’m confident to say that the concepts I’m learning will stick with me as I continue growing in my career/profession.</p>
